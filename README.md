# SpringBootLearning-2CrudRepo
Create a Java class representing the entity you want to persist in the database.
Annotate the class with @Entity to mark it as a JPA entity.
Define the necessary fields and their corresponding getters and setters.
Optionally, annotate the primary key field with @Id and specify the generation strategy using @GeneratedValue.
Step 2: Create the Repository Interface

Create an interface that extends the CrudRepository interface provided by Spring Data JPA.
Pass in the entity class and the type of the primary key as type arguments, e.g., CrudRepository<Product, Long>.
Annotate the interface with @Repository to indicate that it's a repository bean.
Step 3: Use the Repository in your Service or Controller

Inject the repository interface into your service or controller classes using @Autowired.
Utilize the methods provided by the repository interface to perform CRUD operations on the entity.
For example, you can use methods like findAll(), findById(), save(), deleteById(), etc., to retrieve, store, update, and delete entity instances.
Note: Ensure that your Spring Boot application is configured with the necessary dependencies, such as Spring Data JPA and a database driver for the database you're using.

By following these steps, you'll have a CRUD repository set up in your Spring Boot application, allowing you to easily perform database operations on your entity objects.
